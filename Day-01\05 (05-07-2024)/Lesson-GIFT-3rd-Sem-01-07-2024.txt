    =   How to declare a class?
        [access-specifier]
        [modifier]
        class <className>
        [extends <parentClass>]
        [implements <interfaces.....>]
        {}

    =   [access-specifier]
        1. public
        2. protected
        3. private
        4. <undefined>

    =   [modifier]
        1. abstract
        2. final
        3. static
        4. native
        5. sychronized
        6. transient
        7. volatile
        8. strictfp

    =   class <className>
        class is a keyword that allows to create a class.
        Rules for creating class name:
        1.  A class name is created using uppercase alphabetic [A-Z], lowercase alphabetic
            [a-z], digit [0-9], special characters like dollar [$] and underscore [_]

        2.  A class should start with an uppercase alphabetic character
        3.  A class may also start with lowercase alphabetic and special characters like
            dollar [$] and [_]
        4.  There is no restriction imposed on the length of the name

            $Mercy                                              valid
            _Underscore                                         valid

    =   [extends <parentClass>]
        extends inherits another class called the parentClass.

    =   [implements <interfaces.....>]
        When a class is partially inherited, we use implements through an interface.

    =   {}
        The body of the class.
        A body of the class contains, fields/global-variables, constrctors and methods/functions.

    =   The loops:
        There are 4 types of loops in Java:
        1.  for([initializer]; [condition]; [incrementor]) {}
            The statements in the body of for loop executes continuously as long as the
            condition of the loop is fulfilled.
        2.  This loop works with array:
            String[] days = {"Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"};
        3.  The while loop:
            while(condition) {}
            This will iterate as long as the condition is fulfilled.
        4.  do loop:
            The do loop executes at least once. After the first time it checks the condition.
            do {} while(condition);
    
    =   There are 2 clauses with all the above loop
        1.  break;      //  break, breaks out from the loop
        2.  continue;   //  jumps to the starting point

    =   WAP to print all multiplication tables between 2 and 40?
