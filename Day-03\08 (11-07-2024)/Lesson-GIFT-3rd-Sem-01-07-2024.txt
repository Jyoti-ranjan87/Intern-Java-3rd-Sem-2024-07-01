    =   How to declare a class?
        [access-specifier]
        [modifier]
        class <className>
        [extends <parentClass>]
        [implements <interfaces.....>]
        {}

    =   [access-specifier]
        1. public
        2. protected
        3. private
        4. <undefined>

    =   [modifier]
        1. abstract
        2. final
        3. static
        4. native
        5. sychronized
        6. transient
        7. volatile
        8. strictfp

    =   class <className>
        class is a keyword that allows to create a class.
        Rules for creating class name:
        1.  A class name is created using uppercase alphabetic [A-Z], lowercase alphabetic
            [a-z], digit [0-9], special characters like dollar [$] and underscore [_]

        2.  A class should start with an uppercase alphabetic character
        3.  A class may also start with lowercase alphabetic and special characters like
            dollar [$] and [_]
        4.  There is no restriction imposed on the length of the name

            HelloStudentOfGift3rdSemesterHowAreYou              valid
            HelloStudentOfGift3rdSemester@HowAreYou             not valid
            $Mercy                                              valid
            _Underscore                                         valid
            24praganas                                          not valid

    =   [extends <parentClass>]
        extends inherits another class called the parentClass.

    =   [implements <interfaces.....>]
        When a class is partially inherited, we use implements through an interface.

    =   {}
        The body of the class.
        A body of the class contains, fields/global-variables, constrctors and methods/functions.

    =   The loops:
        There are 4 types of loops in Java:
        1.  for([initializer]; [condition]; [incrementor]) {}
            The statements in the body of for loop executes continuously as long as the
            condition of the loop is fulfilled.
        2.  This loop works with array:
            String[] days = {"Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"};
        3.  The while loop:
            while(condition) {}
            This will iterate as long as the condition is fulfilled.
        4.  do loop:
            The do loop executes at least once. After the first time it checks the condition.
            do {} while(condition);
    
    =   There are 2 clauses with all the above loop
        1.  break;      //  break, breaks out from the loop
        2.  continue;   //  jumps to the starting point

    =   WAP to print all multiplication tables between 2 and 40?

    =   What are the content of a class?
        A class contains 3 members:
        1.  Field/Global variables members
        2.  Constructor members
        3.  Method/Function members
        4.  Destructor members
        5.  Inner classes

    =   What are field members?
        class Planet {
            // field members
            String name;
            double distance;
            String color;

            //  Constructors
            public Planet() {
            }
            public Planet(String name, double distance, String color) {
            }

            //  Method/Function members
            public String getName() {
            }

            public String getName(String x) {
            }

            public String getName(double d) {
            }

            public String getColor() {
            }

            public double getDistance() {
            }

            public void Planet() {
            }
        }

    =   What is instanciation?
    =   INSTATIATION
        primary (object always resides in primary)

              a   b   c    q    t   x       y       |
               \  |  /      \   |    \     /        |
        --------\-|-/--------\--|-----\---/---------|-- new
                 \|/          \ |      \ /          |
               String          \|       B           |
                                A                Integer

    =   There are basically 3 types of programs in Java:
        1.  Application
            Starts from the main method.
            Paticularly the main method must be
            public static void main(String args[]) {}
        2.  Applet
        3.  Servlet

    =   How classes are arranged?
            package-1
            +-  class-1
            +-  class-2
            +-  class-3
            package-2
            +-  class-101
            +-  class-201
            +-  class-301
            package-3
            +-  class-1001
            +-  class-2002
            +-  class-3003

    =   OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming

    =   Programming Language Paradigms:
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-encapsulation-inheritance-polymorphism-abstraction-in-oops/
        1.  Imperative programming paradigm
            >   Procedural programming paradigm
            >   Object oriented programming
            >   Parallel processing approach
        2.  Declarative programming paradigm
            >   Logic programming paradigms
            >   Functional programming paradigms
            >   Database/Data driven programming approach

    =   What are the features of OOPs?
        There are 3 features:
        1.  Encapsulation
            When the data and the code are wrapped within one unit,
            it is known as encapsulation. Abstraction is a part of
            encapsulation.
        2.  Inheritance
            A class may inherit another class. When the child class
            inherits the parent class, the properties of the parent
            class becomes the property of the child class.

            public class GrandFather {
                String name = "Jawaharlal Nehru";
            }

            public class Parent extends GrandFather {
                String name = "Rajeev Gandhi";
            }

            public class Child extends Parent {
                public Child() {
                    System.out.println(name);       //  Rajeev Gandhi
                }
            }

        >   parent          child           used in Smart Talk
            base            derived         used in C++
            super           sub             used in Java

    =   Polymorphism    - poly means many and morph means forms
        When one or more methods/functions have same name with the
        same class or within the parent class and the child class
        it is known as polymorphism. Multiple entities having same
        name is polymorphism.

        There are 2 forms of polymorphism:
        1.  Overloading of methods
            When more than one method have same name with different
            parameter list in the same class it is known as overloading
        2.  Overriding of methods
            When a method is declared in the parent class and at the
            same time in the child class with same parameter list, it
            is known as overriding

        class Example {
            public static void main() {
            }

            public static void main(int x) {
            }

            public static void main(String y) {
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
            }
        }

        class Sample extends Example {
            public static void main() {
            }

            public static void main(int x) {
            }
        }

    =   The java.lang package
        >   String
        >   StringBuffer
        >   StringBuilder

    =   ASSIGNMENTS
        1.  WAP to sum first 50 odd numbers?
        2.  WAP to find 10 subsequent number is the series
            1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..........
            1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..........
